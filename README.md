# Crack_The_Box #
A basic guess the number between 0 and 9999 game, written in Python, designed for CMD of WT.  

# How To Run #
If you do not have Python installed, along with the colorama module, or you do not have CMD  
(Windows Command Prompt) or WT (Windows Terminal) that you know of, use the .exe. Otherwise,  
run the .bat file, which will detect what terminal you have and use the best looking one.

If you prefer, and you have Python installed. You can run the game either by calling 
```python -m crack_the_box``` from the folder's parent directory. You could optionally just
move into the ```crack_the_box``` folder and call ```python __main__.py```, 
```"Crack The Box.bat"```, or just ```"Crack The Box.exe"```.
